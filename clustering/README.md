You can view this by using the NBViewer: [Click Here to View This Folder](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DataKind-SF/datadive_201503_sf-health-improvement-partnership/tree/master/clustering/)


To fill out the `clustering_outputs` folder run the file:

```
KMeans Clustering Crime & Alcohol Off-Site Sales Locations- Cluster Output Script.ipynb
```


The visual folder holds a small javascript application that runs with just a local server
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Then navigate to localhost:8000 and you'll see the application (assuming you ran the above command from inside the visual folder)

Then you'll see a map of San Francisco with some data plotted on it. This was a prototype to see what the data might look like using JavaScript
